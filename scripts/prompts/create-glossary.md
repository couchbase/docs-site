= TASK: create a `glossary.adoc` for Couchbase docs

* Start with `llms.txt`, a hierarchical index of Couchbase docs.
* Descend into any relevant docs pages to gather important keywords and gather a short glossary text for each keyword.
* The glossary text should be as short as a few words for simple entries, or as long as a paragraph (3-6 sentences).
* List all glossary items in a single list with headings for A-Z

= NOTABLE TOPICS

The keywords chosen should be about:

* Couchbase technologies and services
* NoSQL and SQL++ databases
* Important devops, development, and deployment terminology related to Couchbase
* Where relevant to learning or managing Couchbase, more general technical terminology

If in doubt about whether a keyword is notable enough to include, then go ahead and add it.

= OUTPUT: In Asciidoc

Even though these sources are in Markdown, we want the `glossary.adoc` to be output in Asciidoc.

If there's already a `glossary.adoc` file, you are free to overwrite this.
