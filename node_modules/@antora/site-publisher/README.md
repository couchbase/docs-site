# Antora Site Publisher

The Site Publisher is a component in Antora responsible for publishing (i.e., writing) the generated files to the destination(s) specified in the playbook.
More than one destination may be specified, and this component supports different destination types (via providers) such as a filesystem directory or an archive file.
Custom providers can be used to add support for additional destinations.

[Antora](https://antora.org) is a modular static site generator designed for creating documentation sites from AsciiDoc documents.
Its site generator pipeline aggregates documents from versioned content repositories and processes them using [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org).
