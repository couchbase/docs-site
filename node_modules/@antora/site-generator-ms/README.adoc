= Antora site generator for MS

A tailored Antora site generator that provides early access to features planned for a future release of Antora.
Among these features, it resolves unsatisfied xrefs in a microsite to those in a primary site.

== Installation

 $ npm install -g gitlab:opendevise/oss/antora-site-generator-ms

or

 $ npm link

== Usage

 $ NODE_PATH="$(npm -g root)" antora --generator @antora/site-generator-ms playbook.yml

NOTE: The `NODE_PATH` assignment is necessary to ensure Antora can locate node modules install globally.
Depending on your environment, you may find that this assignment is unnecessary.

The supplemental sitemap will be written to the file [.path]_supplemental-sitemap.json_ in the output directory.
