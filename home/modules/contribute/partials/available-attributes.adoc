| `:page-topic-type:` 
| The page topic type sets the content type for a page and automatically adds a corresponding badge.
These badges help users quickly identify the kind of content they're going to find on a page. 
a| * For concepts: `concept`
* For tasks: `guide`
* For references: `reference`

| `:keywords:`
| Use the `keywords` attribute to add meta keywords to the HTML head for your page. 
| Any applicable keyword, separated by commas (`,`).

| `:description:` 
| The page description is used for SEO and provides a brief description of the page, which is displayed using the `[abstract]` attribute on the page.

| `:imagesdir:`
a| Use the `imagesdir` attribute to set where Antora should resolve the location of images included in a page. 
By default, the value of `imagesdir` is empty, and image paths are resolved relative to the current page. 

Set the `imagesdir` to avoid hard-coding image paths when writing an include, as Antora will automatically prefix any path with the set value.

For example, the following would become a valid image include: 

----
image::name-of-image.png[]
----
a| `:imagesdir: ../assets/images`

Try to keep your images inside the `assets/images` folder in a module.

| `:page-aliases:` 
a| Use the `page-aliases` attribute when you need to delete or rename a page to avoid breaking links.
Antora will resolve any links to the filename(s) you specify in this attribute to redirect to the current page, instead.

[WARNING]
====
You should only use `page-aliases` if it's absolutely necessary.
It's not designed to be a general-purpose URL router, and it can get noisy and chaotic to maintain a large number of `page-aliases` on a page, or across pages. 

Do your part to keep the AsciiDoc files clean and easy to understand. 
Try to appropriately name your pages from the start.
====
| A xref:cross-references.adoc[valid cross reference] to a page.

For a page in the same module: `:page-aliases: search-query.adoc`

For a page in a different module: `:page-aliases: ROOT:search-query.adoc`

For a page in another repository: `:page-aliases:7.6@server:develop:integrations.adoc`

When linking to a repository that has a version, you must specify which version in that repository redirects to your current page.

| [[page-edition]]`:page-edition:`
| If you're writing content that only applies to a specific edition of Couchbase Server, usually the Enterprise Edition, use the `page-edition` attribute to add a badge to the page that indicates the Edition the content applies to.
| `page-edition: Enterprise Edition`

| `:page-layout:`
| Sets the UI layout to assign to a page. 
By default, pages use the `default.hbs` template from the https://github.com/couchbase/docs-ui[docs-ui repository^]. 
| For the list of all available templates, see https://github.com/couchbase/docs-ui/tree/master/src/layouts[the docs-ui repository].

| `:page-pagination:`
a| Include the `page-pagination` attribute to add pagination to the bottom of a page.

Set the attribute to `prev` to allow the user to navigate to the previous and next pages surrounding the current page in the module's table of contents. 

Set the attribute to `next` to include only navigation going to the next topic in the table of contents. 

For an example of `page-pagination`, see xref:server:guides:insert.adoc[the Server documentation].
a| `:page-pagination: prev`

`:page-pagination: next`

| `:page-partial:`
| Allows this page to be included inside another page as a xref:includes.adoc#partial-files[partial file].
You only need to set this attribute on a page that you add to the `pages` directory of a module.
| `:page-partial:`

| `:page-role:` 
a| Assign a role to a page to change the default CSS or add new CSS styles to the entire page.
The exact behavior depends on the assigned role. 

The `page-role` attribute can take multiple values, separated by a single space. 
a| `:page-role: tiles`: Arranges and renders H2 headings as tiles, in 2 columns down the page. 

`:page-role: -toc`: Removes the in-page table of contents from a page.
Useful for landing pages.

| `:page-status:`
| If you're writing content that only applies to a beta or specific software version, use the `page-status` attribute to mark the page with a badge. 
a| Any valid software name and version. 

For example, `:page-status: Couchbase Server 7.2`

| [[page-toclevels]]`:page-toclevels:` 
| Use the `page-toclevels` attribute to control the depth of headings displayed on the in-page table of contents, at the right of the document contents. 
By default, the in-page table of contents only displays Heading 2 (H2) headings. 
Set the attribute to any value greater than or equal to `2` to increase the heading depth displayed.
a| `page-toclevels: <Any integer greater than 1>`

| `:sectids:`
a| xref:attributes-and-roles.adoc#unsetting-a-document-attribute[Unset] the `sectids` attribute to stop automatically generating section IDs for headings inside an AsciiDoc file. 

If `sectids` is left set for a document, section IDs for xref:cross-references.adoc[cross references] are generated based on the content of the heading, replacing spaces with dashes. 

You can always override these automatic IDs by assigning your own. 
a| `:sectids:` (set)

`:!sectids:` (unset)

| `:tabs:`
a| To add the tabs feature to your page and allow tabbed content blocks, you must set the `tabs` attribute.
