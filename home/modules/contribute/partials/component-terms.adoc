The Couchbase repositories that contain documentation use a standard directory structure and nomenclature.
This ensures that Antora can locate the documentation components, collect the content files, and then build docs.couchbase.com.

Component::
A documentation component contains AsciiDoc files, their optional assets and examples, one or more optional navigation files, and a component descriptor file per repository.
All of the files in a component are versioned together.

--
While it is common to find all of a component's files in a single repository, a component can be distributed across several repositories.
The Server component is aggregated from the _docs-server_, _couchbase-cli_, _backup_, and _asterix-opt_ repositories.

A component isn't recognized by a repository or directory.
Instead, the presence of a file named _antora.yml_ indicates that the directories and files nested under it are part of a component.
--

Component Descriptor::
A component must contain a component descriptor file named _antora.yml_.
When Antora finds _antora.yml_ in a repository, it knows it has located a component (or part of component).
The component descriptor tags the files under its hierarchy with the specified component name and version.

Component-Version::
In these contributing pages, DOCs issues, and the Antora documentation, the term _component-version_ is used when discussing concepts that apply to a version of a component.
It's important to remember that a component's name and a component's version *may be very different* than the names of the repository and branch where it's stored.

Module::
A module is a discrete bundle of content, including text, images, and other source materials, organized in a hierarchy of folders by content format, then by optional topic if needed.
A module is stored in a component's _modules_ directory.
A component can contain one or more modules.

ROOT Module::
The ROOT module contains all the content that's directly associated with the component itself.
When pages in the ROOT module are published, these pages are promoted a level above any other modules' pages in that component's URL.

Pages::
The _pages_ directory contains a module's AsciiDoc files.
These files are automatically converted to standalone HTML pages.
See the xref:pages.adoc[Standard Document Structure] to learn how to structure an AsciiDoc file.

[[partials-dir]]Partials::
The _partials_ directory contains AsciiDoc files that aren't standalone pages.
These files are referenced by an xref:includes.adoc[include directive] from a document in the _pages_ directory.

Assets::
Multimedia and supplemental files, organized by format, are stored in the _assets_ directory.
Photographs, screenshots, and graphic files in _assets/images_ are inserted into pages using the xref:basics.adoc#images[image macro].

[[examples-dir]]Examples::
Non-AsciiDoc files, such as source code, are stored in the _examples_ directory.
These files are often inserted into xref:code-blocks.adoc[code blocks] using an xref:includes.adoc[include directive].

Navigation::
A xref:update-nav.adoc[navigation file], often named _nav.adoc_, contains one or more AsciiDoc lists.
Antora uses these files to build the site's xref:nav-menus-and-files.adoc[component navigation menus].
