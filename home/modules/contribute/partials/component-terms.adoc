All Couchbase Documentation repositories use a standard directory structure and some common files and features.
This ensures that Antora can locate the documentation components, collect the content files, and then build docs.couchbase.com.

Here are some key terms for Couchbase Documentation repositories and files: 

Component::
A component contains: 
* AsiiDoc content files
* Assets, like images 
* Examples, like code samples
* Navigation files 
* A component descriptor file (`antora.yml`).
+
All of the files in a component are versioned together, based on the `antora.yml`.
+
Components can sometimes be distributed across several GitHub repositories. 
For example, the component for the Server documentation is built from `docs-server`, `couchbase-cli`, `backup`, and `asterix-opt`. 

All components are identified by `antora.yml` - not a repository or directory.

Component Descriptor::
A component must contain a component descriptor file named _antora.yml_.
When Antora finds _antora.yml_ in a repository, it knows it has located a component (or part of component).
The component descriptor tags the files under its hierarchy with the specified component name and version.

Component-Version::
A component version is a specific version of the documentation stored in a component. 
Component names and component versions do not always map to a GitHub repository and branch. 
They can be set and modified independently from the GitHub repository and branch structure. 

Module::
Modules organize content files, including text, images, and code samples, inside a component. 
Modules are stored under the `modules` folder in a component. 
Components can contain multiple modules. 

ROOT Module::
The `ROOT` module contains necessary top-level content associated with a component.
For example, the `ROOT` module contains the navigation files for a component.
When pages in the `ROOT` module are published, these pages are promoted a level above any other modules' pages in that component's URL.

Navigation Files::
The `ROOT` module usually contains a navigation file called `nav.adoc`.
It contains an unordered list of xref:cross-references.adoc[cross references] to documentation pages in specific modules inside the component. 
Antora uses navigation files to build xref:nav-menus-and-files.adoc[navigation menus] for a component. 
For more information about working with navigation files, see xref:update-nav.adoc[].

Pages::
A `pages` directory exists under a specific module in the `modules` directory.
The `pages` directory specifically contains any AsciiDoc text files for whole pages in the Couchbase Documentation.
For more information about structuring files in the `pages` directory, see xref:pages.adoc[].

[[partials-dir]]Partials::
A `partials` directory exists under a specific module in the `modules` directory.
The `partials` directory contains AsciiDoc files that can be inserted inside files in the `pages` directory.
This is helpful for content reuse and single-sourcing information across multiple pages. 
For more information about partials, see xref:includes.adoc[].

Assets::
An `assets` directory exists under a specific module in the `modules` directory.
The `assets` directory can contain sub-directories, like `images`, that organize images and other multimedia files for the documentation. 
You can insert files in these directories into files in the `pages` directory.
For more information about how to insert images into documentation, see xref:basics.adoc#images[].

[[examples-dir]]Examples::
An `examples` directory exists under a specific module in the `modules` directory. 
The `examples` directory contains non-AsiiDoc or image files, usually source code, for inserting as examples into the documentation. 
For more information about how to work with code examples, see xref:code-blocks.adoc[].
