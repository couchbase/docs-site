= Anywhere Footnotes

One of the AsciiDoc extension extras we run on the site is Anywhere footnotes. 
This extension allows you to add footnotes to the page, 
with the block of references appearing anywhere on the page. 
(Regular AsciiDoc footnotes always appear right at the bottom).

This is very handy for pages where you have multiple tables appearing on the page, like this:

.Sample Table Title
