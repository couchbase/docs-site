== Download and Install Git

You need Git in order to work with repositories cloned to your computer
i.e., local repositories.

////
To see if you have Git, open a terminal and type:

[source,console]
 $ git --version

If a version number is not returned below the command line, you don't have Git and need to install it.

You can install Git using Brew (MacOS), Chocolatey (Windows), or your Linux distribution's package manager.
Alternatively, you can download it from the https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git project].
