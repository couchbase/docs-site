= Test Your Changes Locally

To build the Couchbase Documentation site on your computer, make sure that you have: 

* xref:install-antora.adoc[Installed Antora]
* xref:playbook.adoc[Configured a local playbook file]

Then, you need to start by configuring your Git credentials in Antora. 

== Configure Your Git Credentials 

If you left some remote repositories in your local playbook file, make sure you configure your GitHub credentials so Antora can access those repositories during a build: 

. Go to the GitHub webpage for the remote repository to make sure you have access. 
. https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic[Configure a classic personal access token (PAT) for your GitHub account^] with the `repo` scope. 
+
Keep the PAT somewhere where you can copy it again later.
+
Make sure you also authorize your token to work with SAML single sign-on. 
. Open a Git Bash window. 
+
You should have automatically installed Git Bash when you installed Git on your computer. 
. Paste the following command: 
+
[source, console]
----
git config --global credential.helper store && \
git ls-remote -h https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-operator > /dev/null && \
git config --global --remove-section credential
----
. Paste your PAT after the first prompt, then hit kbd:[Enter] twice. 
+
This stores your PAT in the `$HOME/.git-credentials` file on your computer. 

== Generate a Local Build with Antora 

To generate a local build of the documentation site, as configured by your local playbook file: 

. Open a terminal. 
. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the `docs-site` repository:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd <path/to/docs-site/repository>
----
. Enter the following command to tell Antora to run using your local playbook file: 
+
[source,console]
----
$ antora local-antora-playbook.yml
----

Antora starts by showing the cloning progress of each repository in the playbook. 
Then, any AsciiDoc or Antora warning or error messages for each file in the build will show. 

* Warnings indicate that a file contains invalid AsciiDoc syntax.
The site still builds, but pages might not display correctly if they have incorrect syntax. 
* Errors can indicate broken links or other issues.
Some errors might cause the site build to fail. 

When the site build finishes, Antora should display a message saying `Site generation complete!`.
The command prompt reappears in your terminal. 

== Review the Changes in Your Build 

TIP: Some terminal programs might display a prompt that lets you directly open the site build from the terminal. 

. Using your terminal or a file explorer, inside the `docs-site` repository, navigate to the `public` folder. 
. Do one of the following: 
.. If your operating system supports it, enter the following command into your terminal: 
+
[source,console]
----
$ open index.html
----
.. In your file explorer, double-click `index.html`. 

+
Your web browser should open your local build just like any other website. 
. Review the changes in your local build to make sure everything appears as expected. 

You can make changes to the files in a repository and re-run Antora locally as many times as you need.
