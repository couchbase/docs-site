= AsciiDoc

AsciiDoc is a lightweight markup language that supports the structural and semantic elements necessary for writing web-first, technical documentation.
It is the native markup language of Antora.

== Naming Files

* Use all lowercase letters.
* Separate words with hyphens.
* Save AsciiDoc files with the _.adoc_ extension.
* Don't use symbols or special characters.

Antora uses a file's name to create its page URL, so *changing a file's name will break cross references (xrefs) and incoming links to the page from external websites*.
