== Bold, Italic, and Code Styles

[source,asciidoc]
----
include::example$inline-styles.adoc[]
----

Renders as:

include::example$inline-styles.adoc[]

You can add multiple inline styles to text as long as the syntax is placed in the correct order.

* Monospace syntax (`++`++`) is always the outermost formatting set.
* Bold syntax (`*`) must be outside the italic formatting set.
* Italic syntax (`_`) is always the innermost formatting set.

To mark up code blocks, include example files, and add callouts, see xref:code-blocks.adoc[Code Blocks and Callouts].

[#ui-macros]

== URLs

URLs that begin with one of the common schemes (`http`, `https`, `ftp`, `irc`, `mailto`, or any email address) are turned into links automatically.
You can specify the link text in square brackets immediately after the URL.
Avoid using the `link:` macro -- you'll only need it in rare circumstances, such as for links with unusual schemes.

Links to external websites should all open in a new tab, so that readers don't leave our documentation.
To specify this, end the link text with a caret `^`.

*Don't use URLs or system paths to link between docs.couchbase.com documents.*
Document-to-document links are created with xref:cross-references.adoc[cross references] to ensure domain, component, and version portability.

=== Escaping URLs

When a URL should be inactive, you can escape it by placing a backslash (`\`) directly in front of it.
To style and escape a URL, use the `+` passthrough inside any inline style markup.

[source,asciidoc]
----
If it is not specified, the default URL \http://localhost:8091 is used.

If it is not specified, the default URL `+http://localhost:8091+` is used.
----

Renders as:

If it is not specified, the default URL \http://localhost:8091 is used.

If it is not specified, the default URL `+http://localhost:8091+` is used.

=== URL Best Practices

* Always use the secure `https://` scheme for external webpage links.
* Escape `+http://localhost+` URLs in regular text so they don't become links.
* Create attributes for long URLs to improve the source readability for other contributors.
* Create attributes for URLs that contain sets of symbols, such as multiple underscores (`_`) and backticks (`++`++`), that could be misinterpreted as inline markup.
* Create attributes for URLs used several times on the same page.
* Don't use URLs for linking between documentation pages or to in-page anchors.

xref:update-nav.adoc[Navigation files] also use the unordered list syntax.

[#images]
== Images

The block image macro (`image::[]`) and the inline image macro (`image:[]`) accept SVG, PNG, JPG/JPEG, and GIF file formats.

Block images, indicated by two colons (`::`), are entered on their own line and displayed on their own line.
Optional attributes and values are entered inside the macro's attribute list (`[]`).
In the <<block,block image example>>, the first positional value is empty, so the opening square bracket (`[`) is directly followed by a comma (`,`).
The second positional value, `280`, indicates the maximum width of the image.
The next attribute, `align`, and its assigned value `left`, places the image against the left page margin.

If the macro's attribute list is empty (e.g., `image::filename.jpg[]`), the image is displayed at its original size and centered on the page.

[#block]
.Block image
[source,asciidoc]
----
image::console-login.png[,280,align=left]
----

Renders as:

image::console-login.png[,280,align=left]

The inline image macro, indicated by a single colon (`:`), is used for displaying small images and icons directly in the flow of a sentence.

.Inline image
[source,asciidoc]
----
Click the image:edit.svg[,16] icon.

Renders as:

Click the image:edit.svg[,16] icon.

== Admonitions

There are five built-in admonition labels.

* NOTE
* TIP
* IMPORTANT
* CAUTION
* WARNING

.Basic admonitions
[source,asciidoc]

include::example$admonitions.adoc[tag=basic]

.Compound admonition
[source,asciidoc]
----
include::example$admonitions.adoc[tag=compound]
----

Renders as:

include::example$admonitions.adoc[tag=compound]

A compound admonition is any admonition block that contains more than one paragraph or contains a block other than a paragraph.
The contents of the block must be wrapped in the example block delimiters and the admonition type must be assigned as the block style.

== Footnotes

To avoid disrupting the flow of the text to include addendum information, you can tuck the information away in a footnote.
You make footnotes using the footnote macro.

[source,asciidoc]
----
include::example$footnotes.adoc[]
----

Renders as:

include::example$footnotes.adoc[]

TIP: The ID, which is specified using the target slot of the macro, is optional.
By assigning an ID (e.g., fn-1), you can reuse the footnote multiple times in the document, as show in the above example.
You only have to specify the footnote text on the first occurrence.
The text can be filled in using an attribute reference.

== Tables

Tables are delimited by `|===` (a vertical bar followed by three equals signs).
The number of columns in a table is determined by the number of cells found in the first non-blank line after the table delimiter (`|===`) or by the values assigned to the `cols` attribute.
A new cell is created each time the processor encounters a vertical bar (`|`).
Cells are grouped into rows.
Each row must share the same number of cells, taking into account any column or row spans.

.Table with implicit column value and header row
[source,asciidoc]
----
|=== <1>
|Name of Column 1 |Name of Column 2 <2> <3>

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1 <4>

|Cell in column 1, row 2 |Cell in column 2, row 2 <5>
|===
----
<1> A table is delimited by `|===`.
<2> When a cell, marked by a vertical bar (`|`), is placed on the line directly below the delimiter, it is interpreted as a header row.
<3> The number of cells found in the header row indicates the number of columns (sets `cols` implicitly).
<4> The cells in a row can be entered on separate lines.
<5> The cells in a row can be entered on the same line.

Renders as:

|===
|Name of Column 1 |Name of Column 2

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2 |Cell in column 2, row 2
|===

Since tables are AsciiDoc block elements they can have titles, roles, xref:ids.adoc[IDs], as well as table-specific attributes.

.Table with title, ID, `cols`, and `options="header"`
[source,asciidoc]
----
.Optional title
[#optional-id,cols="1,1,2",options="header"] <1> <2> <3> <4>
|===

|Name of Column 1
|Name of Column 2
|Name of Column 3

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1
|Cell in column 3, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|Cell in column 3, row 2
|===
----
<1> If assigned, an ID must be set first in the table's attribute list.
<2> The number of values assigned to `cols` indicates the number of columns, in this case, the table has three columns.
<3> The proportion of each value assigned to `cols` relative to its other values indicates the width of each column.
In this example, column 1 and column 2 will be half the width of column 3.
<4> To make the first row a header row, assign `header` to the `options` attribute.

Renders as:

.Optional title
[#optional-id,cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===

|Name of Column 1
|Name of Column 2
|Name of Column 3

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1
|Cell in column 3, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|Cell in column 3, row 2
|===

Here's an example of a table with a title, implicit header row, and the proportional width of the two columns set.

=== Block Elements in Tables

Any block-level elements, such as code blocks, lists, admonitions, etc., can be entered into a cell.
However, the specifier `a` (which stands for AsciiDoc) must be placed on the cell, row, or column in order for them to be processed as AsciiDoc blocks.
In the following example, the `a` specifier is placed on the cells containing block elements.

include::example$tables.adoc[tag=adoc]

=== Column and Row Spans

The span factor is the number of columns or rows, including the starting row or column, the cell should span.

* To have a cell span multiple columns, place the span factor and `+` operator directly before the `|` of the starting cell.
* To span multiple rows, place a dot (`.`) directly before the span factor and `+` operator.

=== Table Widths

The default width for a table is set to 100%. There are three ways to override this default:

* Set the width explicitly (in percentage) using the width attribute (e.g., width=50%)
* Set the autowidth option so that table only expands to accommodate the contents (e.g., %autowidth)
* Assign a role to the table to allow the width to be controlled by CSS using presets (e.g., .narrow)

For more information, see the {url-table-width}[Asciidoctor table width documentation^].

=== Table Attributes and Options

There are a lot of AsciiDoc table attributes, options, and specifiers.
For more examples and information, see the {url-tables}[Asciidoctor table documentation^].
