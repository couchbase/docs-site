= Attributes and Roles

== Setting and Referencing Document Attributes

AsciiDoc attributes are optional key value pairs.
They are available and, if applicable, applied to an entire document when set in the document's header.
Each attribute must be entered on its own line.
Some attributes are built-in to Asciidoctor; others are defined especially for the Couchbase documentation or by the writer.
To set a document attribute, enter it in the document header inside a set of colons, followed by a value. (`:attribute-name: value`).

.Examples of document attributes
[source,asciidoc]
....
= Page Title
:page-topic-type: concept // <1>
:source-language: javascript // <2>
:url-downloads: https://www.couchbase.com/downloads // <3>
:tabs: // <4>

Download Sync Gateway from the {url-downloads}[Couchbase downloads page]. // <5>

[source] // <6>

....
<1> Attribute names that start with `page-` are specially handled by Antora.
<2> A value can be assigned to a built-in attribute in the document header.
<3> Writers can set and define their own attributes.
<4> Some attributes are assigned an implicit value.
In this case, the tabs feature is turned on by setting `tabs`.
<5> Reference an attribute in the body of the document by entering the attribute name inside a set of curly brackets (`+{attribute-name}+`).
<6> Code blocks are assigned the source language `javascript`.

== Unsetting an Attribute

Some built-in attributes are set (turned on) by default and set for all of the Couchbase document in the playbook.

For example, section IDs are automatically generated for all of the Couchbase documentation pages.
This occurs because the `sectids` attribute is turned on by default.
To unset (turn off) an attribute on a page, prefix the name with a bang (`!`).

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Page Title
:!sectids: // <1>
----
<1> Unset `sectids` with a `!` so that sections IDs are not generated from the section titles in the document.

See the production and staging Antora playbooks to review which AsciiDoc attributes are currently set and unset for all of the Couchbase documentation pages.

== Using Roles

A role applies alternative or additional CSS styles to a document or an element.
The role's styles are defined in the UI.
The `page-role` attribute applies a role to an entire document.
A role is applied to an inline element or block by prefixing the role name with a dot and entering it in a set of square brackets (`[.role-name]`).

Couchbase has one custom role: `tiles`.
This role is assigned to an entire document using `page-role`.
See the `tiles` role in action on the xref:server:getting-started:starter-kits.adoc[Starter Kits page].
