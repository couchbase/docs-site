= Set Up Your Local Repository

You only need to do these steps the first time you contribute to a repository.

== Fork the Repository

Before you can contribute changes to the Couchbase documentation, you must fork the appropriate repository to your personal GitHub account.

. Go to the appropriate repository on GitHub and click btn:[Fork].
See xref:repositories.adoc#repo-urls[Repository Organization] for the list of active repositories

.How to quickly find the right repository
****
To quickly find a page's source file, click on the image:edit.svg[,16,role=icon] edit icon at the top of the page.
You'll be taken to the page's repository.
Click btn:[Fork].

If there isn't an image:edit.svg[,16,role=icon] edit icon on the page, then the repository can't accept changes using the regular workflow.
See xref:repositories.adoc#repo-special[Repositories that Require Special Handling] for more information or propose fixes and improvements using the btn:[Feedback?] button at the bottom of the page.
****

== Clone the Repository

After you fork the repository, clone it to your device.

. Create or select the folder where you want to store the repository on your device.
. Open a terminal and change into the selected folder.

 $ cd path/to/folder

. Go to your repository on GitHub, and click btn:[Clone or download].
. Click the Clipboard icon to copy the repository's Git URL.
. In your terminal type `git clone`, paste the copied URL, and press kbd:[Enter].
For example, to clone your fork of the docs-server repository, you'd enter:

 $ git clone git@github.com:this-is-you/docs-server.git

. Change into the repository folder created by the clone operation.

 $ cd docs-server

== Sync with the Upstream Repository

You need to connect your local repository to the upstream repository so the two repositories can stay in sync.

. Go to the upstream repository on GitHub, and click btn:[Clone or download].
. Click the Clipboard icon to copy the repository's Git URL.
. In your terminal type `git remote add upstream`, paste the copied URL, and press kbd:[Enter].
For example, to connect to the remote upstream docs-server repository, you'd enter:

 $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:couchbase/docs-server.git

. View the configured upstream and origin values and confirm the URLs are correct.

--
 $ git remote -v

The origin URLs should point to your personal fork, and the upstream URLs should point to the repository in the Couchbase organization.
--

. Download upstream changes.

 $ git fetch upstream

Now you're ready to start working on the documentation.
