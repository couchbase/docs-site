= Standard Document Structure

A standard AsciiDoc document is stored in the _pages_ directory of a module.
They have a header, which includes the document title, and a body, which includes the remainder of the document's content.

[#doc-title]
== Document Title and Header

The title of a document is placed on the first line of the file.
It is specified by one equals sign (`=`), followed by one blank space, and then the text of the title.
*All AsciiDoc documents stored in a _pages_ directory must have a document title*.

On the line directly below the title and subsequent contiguous lines, you can add document attributes.
Each attribute must be entered on its own line.
Document attributes are optional.

----
= The Title of My Document
:page-type: concept
:url-query-tut: https://query-tutorial.couchbase.com/tutorial/#1

This is the body of my document.
Let's get started with N1QL!
----

A single blank line signals the end of the header.
The document body starts on next line that has text.

== Document Sections

A document can be divided into sections by heading titles.
Heading 2 section titles, indicated by two equals signs (`==`), are displayed in the *On This Page* sidebar.

----
== Heading 2 Section Title (H2)

=== Heading 3 Section Title (H3)

==== Heading 4 Section Title (H4)
----

*Don't nest sections out of order*.
For example, a heading 4 section can't be directly inside a heading 2 section; it must be nested inside a heading 3 section.

*Don't apply bold formatting to headings*.

== One Sentence Per Line

Sentences that are part of paragraphs, lists, and tables should be entered on individual lines.
This best practice makes reviewing pull requests and comparing versions of the same file much easier for maintainers.
Also, it helps you find long sentences that need to be restructured (e.g., the first sentence in the example below).

== Establishing Demonstration Indexes

The Java SDK code-example provided in xref:java-sdk::full-text-searching-with-sdk.adoc[Searching with the SDK] contains multiple demonstration calls — each featuring a different query-combination — and makes use of three different index-definitions, related to the `travel-sample` bucket: for the code example to run successfully, the three indexes must be appropriately pre-established.
The definitions are provided in xref:fts-demonstration-indexes.adoc[Demonstration Indexes].
----

== File Format and Name

* Use all lowercase letters.
* Separate words with hyphens.
* Save AsciiDoc files with the _.adoc_ extension.
* Don't use symbols or special characters.

The file's name is used to create its page URL.
*Changing a file's name will break cross references (xrefs) and incoming links to the page from external websites*.
