= Edit Existing Documentation

The following sections describe the document editing process using the Atom editor; however, you can write AsciiDoc in the plain text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.

== General Editing Steps Using Atom

. Make sure you've added the repository directory to the *Project* panel, xref:create-branches.adoc[created a working branch], and switched to it.
The name of your working branch is displayed next to the image:git-branch.svg[,16,role=icon] branch icon at the bottom of the editor.
. In the project panel, expand the repository to view its folders and files.
Locate the page, partial, or example file you want to edit and double click on it to open it in an editor pane.
.. If you're not familiar with the structure of a documentation component, see xref:repositories.adoc#dir-structure[Directory Structure and Key Files].
. Edit the content.
The <<edit-server,next section>> steps through an editing scenario.
.. For AsciiDoc tips and help, see xref:basics.adoc[AsciiDoc Basics].
. If you installed the xref:install-git-and-editor.adoc#adoc-packages[AsciiDoc Preview package], go to menu:Packages[AsciiDoc Preview > Toggle Preview].
A basic preview of the rendered document is displayed in an adjacent pane.
. Press kbd:[Ctrl,S] to save the file.

When your edits are complete, you're ready to xref:test-site.adoc[configure a local playbook] to use your changes and build the site on your device.

== Editing a Page in the Server Component

Let's step through editing a Server component page using Atom.
Now that the documentation has been converted from DITA, you can use all of the features of AsciiDoc to enhance the content and structure of the pages.
The syntax changes described in this section represent some of the improvements you can make.

=== 1. Open the File

In the project panel, in the image:repo.svg[,16,role=icon] docs-server repository, go to menu:modules[backup-restore > pages].
Double click on _backup-restore.adoc_ to open the AsciiDoc file in the editor pane.

=== 2. Set and Reference an Attribute

The built-in AsciiDoc `abstract` style is the _Summary_ displayed on the published pages.
The Docs team wants to use this text in the page's HTML description meta tag.

Set the `description` attribute in the xref:pages.adoc#doc-title[header of the document].

[source,asciidoc]
----

----

Cut ( kbd:[Ctrl,X] ) the paragraph under `+[abstract]+` and paste ( kbd:[Ctrl,V] ) it into the value of `description`.

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Backup and Restore
:description: In a production environment, as part of an overall Disaster Recovery plan, you must plan to back up your entire cluster periodically.
This helps ensure that you do not lose information in the event of a serious failure and minimizes data inconsistency when a restore is required.

To keep the paragraph as xref:pages.adoc#vent[ventilated text (sentence per line)] and not break the header, enter a space after the end of the first sentence, then a `\`.

:description: In a production environment, as part of an overall Disaster Recovery plan, you must plan to back up your entire cluster periodically. \
This helps ensure that you do not lose information in the event of a serious failure and minimizes data inconsistency when a restore is required.
----

To display the description text in the _Summary_, reference the `description` attribute.
An attribute is referenced when its name is enclosed by a set of curly brackets (`+{}+`).

=== 3. Replace List Items with Section Headings and Paragraphs

This page doesn't have any section headings, and therefore no *On This Page* sidebar.
It does have two multi-paragraph bulleted list items that look like good candidates for section headings and section paragraphs.

image::bulleted-list-items.png[]

Remove each list marker (`+*+`) and replace it with two equals signs (`==`).
This turns the content on those lines into xref:pages.adoc#document-sections[heading 2 section titles].

Since the content is no longer structured as a list, remove the list continuation (`+`) markup between the paragraphs.

=== 4. Find and Replace the `cmd` Role

In the original DITA files, there were lots of inline roles (`cmd`, `ui`, `param`, etc.).
Some of these roles were mapped to built-in AsciiDoc syntax.
For instance, when `ui` was assigned to dropdown menu text, it was replaced with the xref:basics.adoc#ui-macros[menu UI macro].
Other roles were simply carried forward, like `cmd`, but weren't associated with any custom styles in the final UI.
You can clean up the document by deleting the unused roles.

Press kbd:[Ctrl,F] to open the Find and Replace panel.
Enter `+[.cmd]+` in the *Find* field and leave the *Replace* field empty.

image::find-and-replace.png[]

Click btn:[Replace All] to delete all of the instances of `+[.cmd]+`.

=== 5. Preview and Save the File

If you installed the  xref:install-git-and-editor.adoc#adoc-packages[AsciiDoc Preview package], go to menu:Packages[AsciiDoc Preview > Toggle Preview].
A basic preview of the rendered document is displayed in an adjacent pane.

image::preview.png[]

Press kbd:[Ctrl,S] to save the file.
In the project panel, the file name will change color, indicating it's unstaged.
