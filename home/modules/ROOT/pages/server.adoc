Couchbase is the modern database for enterprise applications.

Couchbase Server is an open source, distributed, JSON document database.
It exposes a scale-out, key-value store with managed cache for sub-millisecond data operations, purpose-built indexers for efficient queries, and a powerful query engine for executing SQL-like queries.
For mobile and Internet of Things environments Couchbase also runs natively on-device and manages synchronization to the server.
