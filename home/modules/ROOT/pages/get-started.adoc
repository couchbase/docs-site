= Get Started with Couchbase

The Developer Data Platform for Critical Applications in Our AI World.

Couchbase is a multipurpose NoSQL database for transactional, analytical, mobile, and AI applications.
Develop at the edge with offline-first Couchbase Lite, for transactional workloads with SDKs in eleven popular programming languages, for real-time analytics, and build agentic apps (currently in private preview).

The easiest way to get started is to https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-up[sign up to Capella, and our perpetual Free Tier],
then follow along the tutorials that are signposted along the way.

Alternatively, check out the various parts of the Couchbase platform below:

=== icon:rocket[] Real Time Analytics with Capella Columnar SDKs

xref:columnar:intro:intro.adoc[Capella Columnar] brings the power of NoSQL to the world of analytics.
This service integrates seamlessly with the Couchbase Capella cloud platform, enabling the creation of real-time, adaptive applications.

xref:columnar-sdk.adoc[Columnar SDKs] are developed from the ground-up and while they maintain some syntactic similarities with the xref:sdk.adoc[operational SDKs],
they are purpose built for Columnar's analytical use cases.
They support streaming APIs to handle large datasets, as well as the common features expected to be present in any modern database SDK --
such as connection management and robust error handling.
