= Deploy and Manage Couchbase 



The Developer Data Platform for Critical Applications in Our AI World.

Couchbase is a multipurpose NoSQL database for transactional, analytical, mobile, and AI applications.
Our operational and analytical databases can be deployed self-managed or fully-managed as a service offering.
Offline-first mobile takes Couchbase to the edge, and can be synced via App Services in the cloud, or a self-managed Sync Gateway deployment.
AI Services (currently in private preview) simplify building agentic apps.
