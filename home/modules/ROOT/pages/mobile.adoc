Couchbase Mobile brings the power of NoSQL JSON document database to the edge. 
The combination of Sync Gateway and Couchbase Lite provides fast, efficient bidirectional synchronization of data between the edge and the cloud.
This enables you to deploy offline-first mobile and edge applications with greater agility on premises or in any cloud. 
Features include automatic conflict resolution, security, Full-Text Search, and SQL++ querying capabilities.

== Components

Couchbase Mobile consists of:

*https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/current/index.html[Couchbase Lite]* - Embedded NoSQL database for mobile and edge devices. 
Couchbase Lite local storage, querying, and offline operations.

*https://docs.couchbase.com/sync-gateway/current/introduction.html[Sync Gateway]* - Secure, high-performance synchronization server for cloud-to-edge data sync. 
Provides authentication, access control, and RESTful APIs. 
Both on-premises and Capella (cloud) deployments use Sync Gateway.

*https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-edge-server/current/introduction/intro.html[Edge Server]* - Lightweight database for edge/IoT environments. 
Edge Server enables local data processing and synchronization with Couchbase Lite and Capella.

*https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/app-services/references/rest-api-introduction.html[App Services]* - Fully managed synchronization service providing the same sync capabilities as Sync Gateway but without infrastructure management.


== Deployment Options

=== Cloud (Capella)
Components: Couchbase Lite + App Services

* Fully managed cloud solution
* App Services provides managed, scalable synchronization for Capella
* Automatic scaling, maintenance, and cloud-native management

=== On-Premises

Components: Couchbase Lite + Sync Gateway

* Deploy and manage your own infrastructure
* Sync Gateway handles synchronization between devices and Couchbase Server
* Full control over security, data, and hosting

=== Edge/IoT Deployments (Optional)
Components: Couchbase Lite + Edge Server + (Sync Gateway or App Services)

* For lightweight edge computing and IoT environments
* Edge Server enables local data processing at the edge
* Can sync with either on-premises Sync Gateway or cloud-based App Services
* Ideal for scenarios requiring reduced latency and local data processing

== Data Flow

1. Couchbase Lite stores and syncs data locally on mobile devices, supporting offline operations.
2. Sync Gateway (on-prem) or App Services (cloud) manage secure, bidirectional synchronization between devices and the backend database.
3. For edge deployments, Edge Server provides local data processing and sync for IoT/edge devices.
4. Capella offers a fully managed cloud database and sync solution
