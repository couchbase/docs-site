Couchbase Mobile is a comprehensive NoSQL database solution for building offline-first mobile and edge applications. 
It enables seamless data synchronization between devices and the cloud, with automatic conflict resolution and security.

== Components

Couchbase Mobile consists of:

*https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/current/index.html[Couchbase Lite]* - Embedded NoSQL database for mobile and edge devices. 
Couchbase Lite local storage, querying, and offline operations.

*https://docs.couchbase.com/sync-gateway/current/introduction.html[Sync Gateway]* - Secure, high-performance synchronization server for cloud-to-edge data sync. 
Provides authentication, access control, and RESTful APIs. 
Both on-premises and Capella (cloud) deployments use Sync Gateway.

*https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-edge-server/current/introduction/intro.html[Edge Server]* - Lightweight database for edge/IoT environments. 
Edge Server enables local data processing and synchronization with Couchbase Lite and Capella.

*https://docs.couchbase.com/home/cloud.html[Capella]* - Fully managed Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) for Couchbase, including managed mobile sync via App Services.

*https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/app-services/references/rest-api-introduction.html[App Services]* - The managed synchronization layer in Capella, providing the same sync capabilities as Sync Gateway but fully managed in the cloud.


== Deployment Options

=== On-Premises

Components: Couchbase Lite + Sync Gateway + Edge Server

* Deploy and manage your own infrastructure
* Sync Gateway handles synchronization between devices and Couchbase Server
* Full control over security, data, and hosting

=== Cloud (Capella)
Components: Couchbase Lite + App Services + Edge Server

* Fully managed cloud solution
* App Services provides managed, scalable synchronization for Capella
* Automatic scaling, maintenance, and cloud-native management

== Data Flow

1. Couchbase Lite stores and syncs data locally on mobile/edge devices, supporting offline operations.
2. Sync Gateway (on-prem) or App Services (cloud) manage secure, bi-directional synchronization between devices and the backend database.
3. Edge Server provides local data processing and sync for IoT/edge devices.
4. Capella offers a fully managed cloud database and sync solution
