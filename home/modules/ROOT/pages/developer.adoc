= Develop with Couchbase

The Developer Data Platform for Critical Applications in Our AI World.

Couchbase is a multipurpose NoSQL database for transactional, analytical, mobile, and AI applications.
Develop at the edge with offline-first Couchbase Lite, for transactional workloads with SDKs in eleven popular programming languages, for real-time analytics, and build agentic apps (currently in private preview).

=== icon:rocket[] Real Time Analytics with Analytics SDKs

xref:enterprise-analytics:intro:intro.adoc[Enterprise Analytics] brings the power of NoSQL to the world of analytics.
Self-managed Enterprise Analytics brings real-time adaptive applications to your datacenter or private cloud --
or try this service fully-hosted as xref:columnar:intro:intro.adoc[Capella Analytics], which integrates seamlessly with the Couchbase Capella cloud platform.
// Or try self-managed Enterprise Analytics, in your datacenter or private cloud.

////
xref:columnar-sdk.adoc[Columnar SDKs] are developed from the ground-up and while they maintain some syntactic similarities with the xref:sdk.adoc[operational SDKs],
they are purpose built for Enterprise Analytics' analytical use cases.
They support streaming APIs to handle large datasets, as well as the common features expected to be present in any modern database SDK --
such as connection management and robust error handling.
